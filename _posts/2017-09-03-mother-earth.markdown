*Mother Earth* or *Tierra Madre* is idea that earth is our common mother, and that we should respect it, all live creatures on it are equal, and human is not exeption. I want to underline femine nature of our earth, planet, becuase she gives us a birth, and life. Earth is a women, and she is a mother! 
It is not accidental that magazine that was edited by Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman was named "Mother Earth"
